# STM32F334_HRTIM_FullBridge_TIMAB1_DAC12

My own Prototype : Full-bridge DC-DC conveter using STM32F334.

You may have to compile and make it because I cannot upload the project files, debug files and .setting folder.

I encountered a problem on TimerA >>> https://community.st.com/s/question/0D50X0000AyCqnxSQC/stm32f334-hrtim-ta1-does-not-reset.

I did some work around, but if you may have a better solution, please ping me.
